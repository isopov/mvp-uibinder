Here http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/articles/mvp-architecture-2.html
you may read about putting together MVP pattern promoted by Google for GWT
development and UiBinder for xml declarative UI development for GWT. However,
the example for download on this page is totally broken. Here are changes to it
made in this repo:
1. Eclipse configuration was added (.project, .classpath, .settings). GWT 2.4 and 2.4 Google
plugin were used.
2. Proper history support for editing contacts was added (ability to move back and forward
in browser to editing particular contacts, that is absent in both 1st and 2nd original exmaples
for MVP).
3. Black magic of native HTML for table was replaced with binded FlexTable for ContactsView
4. EditContactsView was implemented with UiBinder as well.
5. EventBus instead of non-recomened to this purpose HandlerManager was used.
6. Code cleanup (several bugs were fixed, unused third domain object Address was removed, etc.)

If you are not familiar with git - just download to archive and import it to Eclipse as an existing project.
